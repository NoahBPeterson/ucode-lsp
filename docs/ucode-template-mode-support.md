# ucode template-mode (`{% %}` / `{{ }}`) bring-up

Status: **Phases 1–3 DONE (templates parse with zero syntax errors); phases 4–5
planned.** Investigated 2026-06-08, bring-up started 2026-06-20. Corpus: `firewall4/`,
`luci/`, `snort3/` template `.uc`.

Measured result of phases 1–3 on the firewall4 corpus: `ruleset.uc` 239 diagnostics →
0 parse errors (144 remaining are all UC1001 on render-scope free vars = phase 4);
`zone-verdict.uc` 48 → 0 parse errors (32 remaining UC1001). The UC6004 syntax-error
storm is gone end-to-end.

## Implementation plan (phased)

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Lexer**: stop bailing to 0 tokens on a leading/abutting empty `TK_TEXT`; preserve `TK_EOF` when a file ends on a tag; handle whitespace-trim markers `{%-`/`{%+`/`{{-`/`{#-` and `-%}`/`-}}`; fix the `blockComment` phantom-recursion. | ✅ done |
| 2 | **Parser**: bridge framing tokens to statement boundaries (`bridgeTemplateTokens`: text/`{%` dropped, `%}`/`}}`/`{{` → `;`), so the existing parser consumes templates — `{{a}}{{b}}` → `a; b;`, `{% if(x): %}…{% endif %}` → `if (x): … endif`. Extended the alt-colon form to `if`/`elif`/`else`/`endif` and `while`/`endwhile` (`for`/`endfor` already worked). | ✅ done |
| 3 | **Mode detection** (`detectTemplateMode`, see below) wired into the editor diagnostic path + the cross-file/workspace parse path in `server.ts`. (The provider cursor-context sites — hover/completion/definition — still lex raw; harmless to diagnostics, revisit if needed.) | ✅ done |
| 4 | **Render-scope enforcement** (NOT blanket auto-suppress). `include(path, {scope})` co-locates a literal path + literal scope object (firewall4 does this for every template, top-level included), so the contract is statically knowable. Built: `extractIncludeSites` → `resolveIncludePath` (relative to includer dir, per oracle) → cross-file `buildIncludeScopeIndex` (target → injected keys). The analyzer suppresses UC1001 for injected names (`setInjectedScope`, strict too); `checkIncludeScopes` flags at the include SITE any template free var the scope fails to provide (`computeFreeVariables` − scope − builtins). Wired into `server.ts` (cached index + per-file inject + host diagnostics). | ✅ done |
| 5 | **Tests**: 67 phase-4b tests incl. **live `ucode/utpl` oracle parity** (scope visibility, missing→strict-error, path resolution, parent-local isolation, real firewall4 zone-verdict). | ✅ done |

**Typing (done):** injected names take the TYPE of their scope value at the include site —
literals (`{ direction: "input" }` → string; `42` → integer; `1.5` → double; `true` → boolean;
`null`; `{…}` → object; `[…]` → array; `()=>…` → function), `require("builtinmod")` → that
module type, and bare identifiers resolve transitively to the includer's injected type.
Computed in the index fixpoint (conflicting types across includers → untyped); applied via
`typeChecker.setInjectedScopeTypes` so `type(x)` / member access on an injected name resolve.
Each kind is oracle-checked against ucode's runtime `type()`. (User-module `require("fw4")`
stays untyped — that needs user-module shape inference, a separate feature.)

Oracle-verified semantics (`ucode/utpl`): scope keys become the included file's globals
(builtins stay ambient); a non-provided var is `null` in non-strict, a `Reference error` in
strict; the scope does NOT leak the includer's own LOCALS (enforcement is sound); path
resolves relative to the includer's directory. **Injected scope DOES leak transitively** into
nested includes (a strict grandchild sees a var its parent's site omitted), so the index is a
fixpoint: `available(C) = ⋃ (siteKeys ∪ available(includer))`. Without this the model would
falsely flag `fw4` in `zone-match.uc` (included with only `{egress, rule}` but inheriting
`fw4` from `zone-verdict`).

## `'use strict'` in templates

Oracle-verified (`ucode/utpl`): a template honors `'use strict'` **only when its `{% 'use
strict'; … %}` block leads the file** — any preceding text or `{{ }}` compiles to a `print()`
statement, so the directive is no longer the first STATEMENT and is silently inert (the same
directive-must-be-first rule as raw ucode). Under strict, an undeclared (non-injected) read is
a hard `Reference error`; non-strict it is `null`. Injected render-scope names are valid in
strict too (so the not-strict-gated injected-scope suppression is correct).

Handling: `detectStrictMode` is template-aware. Because the bridge drops leading text, the
directive can look first in the bridged AST when it isn't — so for a template we additionally
require the source to start (after shebang/whitespace) with the `{%` block. Raw scripts are
unaffected (leading comments are already non-statements). Tested with oracle parity
(`test-template-strict-mode`).

**Result on firewall4:** every template reachable from an in-workspace `include()` is now
clean (ruleset 239→0, zone-verdict 48→0, and the rest), host findings 0. Two templates
(`mangle-rule.uc`, `zone-notrack.uc`) are not `include()`d anywhere in the vendored tree —
the open-world case (dynamic/external render). Per the "no blanket auto-suppress" decision,
their frees stay flagged (we can't see a scope to verify against); they'd resolve if their
render site were in the workspace.

## Detection — the canonical rule (from `ucode/main.c`)

Mode is **invocation-determined**, NOT extension- or content-based at the source level:
default `raw_mode = true`; the **`utpl`** binary or **`-T`** flag selects template,
**`-R`** forces raw. **There is no `.ut` convention** — 0 `.ut` files exist in the entire
ucode source; templates use `.uc`, same as raw scripts. (This corrects the earlier draft
below.)

Since the LSP can't see the invocation, replicate the decision from what the file carries,
in priority order:
1. **Shebang, if present** — mirror `main.c`: `utpl`/`-T` ⇒ template; `ucode`/`-R`/`-S`/`env ucode` ⇒ raw.
2. **No shebang** — a leading/embedded template tag `{%` / `{{` / `{#` ⇒ template. Sound,
   not a guess: those byte pairs are not valid raw ucode (`{%` = open-block-then-modulo, a
   syntax error), and this is the only signal the no-shebang OpenWrt corpus carries (it
   covers 100% of it — every real template starts with `{%`, no shebang).
3. **Known-imported modules** (resolved via another file's `import`/`require`) ⇒ raw (a
   module is always compiled raw). Refinement; rarely contradicts #2.

## What already exists (don't rebuild)

- **Token layer is complete**: `TK_TEXT`, `TK_LSTM`/`TK_LEXP`/`TK_RSTM`/`TK_REXP`, the
  block-control keywords `endif`/`endfor`/`endwhile`/`endfunction`, and `TK_COLON` are all
  defined and keyword-mapped.
- **Parser already handles the alt-colon block syntax** (`parseColonEndBlock` in
  `controlFlowStatements.ts`), so `{% if (x): %}…{% endif %}` parses once reached.
- After phase 1 the **lexer fully tokenizes templates** (fw4 `ruleset.uc`: 0 → 3443 tokens).

## Original investigation (2026-06-08) — kept for evidence; detection notes superseded above

## The gap

ucode's **native default is template mode**; the `-R` flag (and module `import`/`require`)
selects raw mode. (This is the same `-R` from the `#!/usr/bin/ucode -R` shebang work.)
OpenWrt's firewall4 ships its entire ruleset generator as ucode *templates*:

```
{%
	let flowtable_devices = fw4.resolve_offload_devices();
-%}
table inet fw4
{% if (fw4.check_flowtable()): %}
delete flowtable inet fw4 ft
{% endif %}
	devices = {{ fw4.set(flowtable_devices, true) }};
```

Syntax in use: `{% stmt %}`, `{{ expr }}`, `{# comment #}`, whitespace-trim variants
`{%+`/`-%}`/`{%-`/`+%}`, and the block-control form `if (…): … endif` / `for (…): … endfor`.

The LSP is **completely broken** on these files. Measured with the real validator:

| file | lines | diagnostics |
|---|---|---|
| `templates/zone-verdict.uc` | 18 | **48** |
| `templates/ruleset.uc` | 473 | **239** |

Every diagnostic is a false positive — a UC6004 "Unexpected token in expression" per block
tag plus a UC1001 "Undefined variable" storm for every `{{ expr }}` identifier
(`fw4`, `rule`, `zone`, `verdict`, …). These `.uc` files are picked up by the workspace
scan, so the Problems panel fills with hundreds of bogus errors.

## Why — three layers, all broken

1. **Validator forces raw mode.** `ast-validator.ts:43` and every parse site in
   `fileResolver.ts` (lines 60, 213, 276, 356, 448, 550, 708, …) hardcode
   `new UcodeLexer(text, { rawMode: true })`. Template mode is never even attempted, so the
   literal nft text (`table inet fw4`) is lexed as code → the UC6004/UC1001 storm.

2. **Lexer template mode bails to 0 tokens.** With `rawMode: false` the default state is
   `UC_LEX_IDENTIFY_BLOCK` and `identifyBlock` *does* emit `TK_TEXT` and transition into
   `TK_LEXP`/`TK_LSTM`/`TK_REXP`/`TK_RSTM` tag states. BUT `emitBuffer` (ucodeLexer.ts)
   returns `null` for an empty `TK_TEXT` buffer:

   ```js
   if (this.buffer.length === 0 && type === TokenType.TK_TEXT) return null;
   ```

   `tokenize()` loops `while ((token = nextToken()) !== null)`. When a template *starts*
   with a tag (`{%…` — the common case), the first `identifyBlock` emits empty `TK_TEXT`
   → `null` → the loop exits immediately → **0 tokens**. Measured: zone-verdict.uc yields
   262 tokens in raw mode, **0** in template mode.

3. **Parser has no template-token awareness.** `TK_LSTM`/`TK_LEXP`/`TK_TEXT`/`TK_REXP`/
   `TK_RSTM` appear nowhere in `src/parser/*.ts`. Even with a fixed lexer, `UcodeParser`
   has no production that consumes interleaved text + tag tokens.

## What a fix needs

- **Mode detection.** Decide template vs raw per file. Options: (a) shebang `-R` ⇒ raw;
  (b) presence of `{%`/`{{…}}` block markers ⇒ template; (c) module files reached via
  `import`/`require` are always raw. firewall4 templates have no shebang and are loaded via
  the template renderer, so marker-sniffing is the practical signal.
- **Lexer fix.** Don't terminate `tokenize()` on a legitimately-empty leading `TK_TEXT`
  (distinguish "empty text between adjacent tags" from EOF). Handle the whitespace-trim
  markers `{%+ -%} {%- +%}` and the `: … endif/endfor/endfor/else` block-control form.
- **Parser.** A template program = sequence of `TK_TEXT` chunks and tag blocks; statement
  tags carry ordinary ucode statements, expression tags a single expression. Identifiers
  inside tags resolve against the render scope (e.g. firewall4 injects `fw4`, `rule`,
  `zone`, `verdict`, `egress`, …) — those are *parameters of the render context*, not
  undefined globals, so UC1001 must not fire for them (likely treat a template's free
  variables as implicit render-scope inputs, similar to the implicit-global handling).

## Scope / priority note

This is not a small patch — it's a second front-end mode through lexer + parser + scope
analysis. But it's the difference between "usable" and "239 false errors" on a flagship
OpenWrt ucode codebase. If a full implementation is too large now, a cheap interim
mitigation is **mode detection that SKIPS diagnostics on detected template files** (emit
nothing rather than garbage) so the Problems panel isn't poisoned by the workspace scan.
